# deadlineSync
As a student juggling multiple projects, classes, and commitments, I noticed a lack of intuitive tools focused on academic-style task management. Existing apps were either too complex or not tailored for personal project tracking.

DeadlineSync was born out of a need to:

Maintain personal and academic deadlines in one place

Avoid missing submission dates and exams

Automate reminders and reduce cognitive load
